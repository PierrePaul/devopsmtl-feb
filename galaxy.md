# Review and rate roles

[https://galaxy.ansible.com/list#/roles](https://galaxy.ansible.com/list#/roles)

    !bash
    pip install ansible --upgrade #make sure you have at least >1.4.0
    galaxy-ansible install user_role

---

# No, I don't want to

By default install everything in /etc/ansible/roles
Obviously, you don't want that.

    !bash
    #~/.ansible.cfg
    [defaults]
    roles_path = ~/Workbench/roles

See the full options : [ansible.cfg](http://docs.ansible.com/intro_configuration.html)
